the problem i faced during this project cannot be written in words 
but i have leraned many things some problems are 

1) i divided every componentsin to very small pices . 
like for home page ,card ,useeffect.

2) i wanted to cover the whole projcet with one states 
and an hardcoded glbal array for movie/upcoming section .by
iterating  over and fetching data dynamicaaly iw ill make them

which wouldnot work,state was messy.and codes llike
dt=movietitle[2]
<moviecard dt/>
looking weird and breking the DRY principal 

3)a single useeffect compo iwll fetch data for every section was another 
mistake.
4)almost every thing fixed the data was overlapping 
like onn the movie section data of tvshos appearing 
(solutin:use different state for them and a toggle option +conditional 
rendering )

the best approach i found was use defferent  states,useeffect,and single 
movie card compo for them all  and a toggle option +condtional rendering 

(let display) if else block //conditional rendering 
<Mrd {isTvShow=true}/> toggle option
